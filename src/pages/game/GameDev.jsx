              Like many, I had an interest in playing video games - specifically
              mobile games. But what really irked my mind was how studios made
              those games; how did they figure out the mechanics, the character
              design, the UI, and other things. With that interest, I made two
              mobile games using the Unity Editor, and my passion for developing
              games only grew. I joined the VGDev club at Georgia Tech and
              helped create an amazing PC game as well. I hope to continue
              making games as a hobby, and maybe even publish a game in the
              future.
