          As part of the VGDev club at Georgia Tech, I helped create a video
          game called Project Obelisk - a 3D isometric shooter, where the player
          must place down weapons in their inventory into a room before being
          able to enter and use those weapons. I also won an award for my
          contributions to the game, and I'm proud to be a part of its creation.
          To look at other projects from VGDev,{" "}

          As the design lead, I worked closely with game lead and the team to
          create and balance game levels and mechanics in the game. I was also
          in charge of a few tasks involving the on-screen UI. I also
          implemented one weapon in the game, along with other improvements to
          gameplay and play style. Check it out{" "}
