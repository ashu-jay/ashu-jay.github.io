        "During the Fall 2023 semester at Georgia Tech, I was enrolled in a class called CS 2261 - Media Device Architecture. The course was based on learning the different components of a computer (in this case, the GameBoy Advance), and how they all come together to work on display. What I particularly liked about this class was that we had to make games as assignments, while learning how pixels, sound, and controls come together. All games were made entirely in C, and I had a lot of fun making games in this class!",

        "One of the early assignments for this class was to make Frogger, and at this point we had just learn about rendering pixels and controlling where those pixels appear - thus making it so that there's a player and they have to cross the obstacles to win. Compared to what we ended up making towards the end of the semester, this game was easy to implement.",

          As the final project for the class, I created a game called 'Acorn
          King', where a tiny squirrel has to climb up a humongous tree in order
          to defeat the Acorn King and claim the crown for itself. This game is
          a classic dodge-the-obstacles game, with a mid-game fight and an
          end-game boss battle. It's a lot of fun, be sure to check it out on
