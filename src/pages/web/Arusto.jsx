          During the summer of 2024, I interned for a startup company called
          Arusto AI, aimed at spreading education through AI-based content
          creation. My work entailed completing multiple tasks involving the
          front-end structure of the product website, as well as implementing
          some back-end functions. This internship was a great opportunity for
          me to improve my skills in React, as well as introduce myself to other
          web development technologies like Next.js, Flask, FastAPI, Material UI
          and Vercel. Check out the main website{" "}

I was also required to make a back-end function to keep a track of how many lessons the user has created in order to show that in the account information.

          Since AI might still be relatively new to educators, our product
          required a step-by-step walkthrough of how to create content. I was in
          charge of making this 'tour', which involved the use of{" "}

          , making it easier to implement. This component was also used to show
          learners how lessons worked, and how to interact with the platform and
          AI.

          We wanted users to know what topics were easy/difficult for students,
          and how much time they spent on different lessons, so that they can
          improve to make better content. So we introduced the Analytics
          section, of which I was responsible for enhancing the look of the
          charts and other data displayed - things like colors, spacing, types
          of charts, and info tips. We used{" "}
